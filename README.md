I can for the love of god not get a Dots build to work. 
I have spent more than a day trying to intall the needed packages to be able to build a Dots project but my Unity keeps freezing, crashing or thousands of unresolved errors so I don't know what to do.
I don't want to spend time on problems that Unity has created so there is no build unless I manage to figure it out some other time.
